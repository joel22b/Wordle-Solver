# Wordle-Solver
A project to help find the solution to word in as few guesses as possible

To make the wordle solver, run the command: 
```
make
```

Once the wordle solver has been made, run it with the command: 
```
./guess
```

It will then output in the terminal the best word to be guessed. You then type in the terminal which letters were black(b), yellow(y), or green(g). It will then filter the remaining word list and write it to a file named guessX.txt. Then a new best word will be output to the terminal.
